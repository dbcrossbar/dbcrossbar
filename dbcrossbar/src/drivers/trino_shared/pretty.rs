//! Pretty-printing support.
//!
//! Because Trino doesn't allow us to define local UDFs, we often need to
//! generate deeply nested SQL. In order to make this even slightly readable, we
//! need to pretty-print it.
//!
//! This is based on [Wadler's "A prettier printer" paper][wadler] and the Rust
//! [`pretty`] crate. I highly recommend reading the Wadler paper; it's
//! clear and interesting, and you're unlikely to understand how any of this
//! works without reading it. This is sort of how Haskell programming
//! worksâ€”there's a really nice and accessible paper somewhere, and without it,
//! nothing makes sense.
