# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.8-pre.2] - 2024-10-29

### Fixed

- `bigquery-test-fixture:`: Retry 503 errors affecting CREATE VIEW calls.

## [0.5.8-pre.1] - 2024-10-22

### Added

- Honor `AWS_ENDPOINT` even if `awscli` does not support it. This is needed for use with some S3 replacements.

### Changed

- redshift: Text columns are now represented as `VARCHAR(MAX)`, which has unlimited size, instead of `TEXT`, which is apparently limited to 255 bytes. This _may_ be a breaking change for some use cases, but RedShift is our least supported driver and we have minimal test infrastructure.

### Security

- Library updates for several advisories.

## [0.5.7] - 2024-01-26

### Added

- gcloud: Allow passing `extra_scopes` to Google OAuth2.

### Security

- Fix [RUSTSEC-2024-0003](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0003), a Denial of Service vulnerability which could apparently cause a hostile HTTP server to cause out-of-memory errors
in a client. Since `dbcrossbar` is unlikely to connect to many hostile HTTP servers, this is probably a low-priority fix for almost all users.

## [0.5.6] - 2024-01-08

### Added

- bigquery: Users can now specify an alternate job project, for example for billing purposes. See docs for details.

## [0.5.5] - 2023-09-14

### Added

- Update to latest `opinionated_telemetry`. This should not affect users.

## [0.5.4] - 2023-09-08

### Added

- Output in JSON Lines format.
- Experimental new support for Prometheus and Google Cloud Trace via [`opinionated_telemetry`](https://github.com/dbcrossbar/dbcrossbar/blob/main/crates/opinionated_telemetry/README.md).

### Removed

- `dbcrossbarlib` is not longer provided separately. As before, we recommend calling out to `dbcrossbar` using the CLI, rather than trying to link against its relatively complex dependencies.

## [0.5.3] - 2023-08-01

### Changed

- The `csv:` driver has been superceded by a more generic `file:` driver. The old CSV driver **will continue to work, perhaps indefinitely,** but it may be increasingly hidden. By default, the `file:` driver determines the file format using the `--from-format` command line argument, or the file extension, falling back to CSV format as a last resort. I _think_ this should be fully backwards-compatible. But if you encounter breaking changes, try adding `--from-format=csv` to your command line.

### Fixed

- Autogenerated `--help` summaries in the docs are now up to date.
- Fixed spelling of `geo_json` in help. Thanks, Tom!
- Fixed handling of empty arrays in `bigquery-test-fixture:`. Thanks, Dave!

## [0.5.2] - 2022-11-03

### Fixed

- Fix CI build and binary releases broken by new warnings in latest Rust update.

## [0.5.1] - 2022-11-03

### Fixed

- bigquery-test-fixture: Add support for single-column inputs. Many thanks to Dave Shirley!
- bigquery-test-fixture: Allow larger outputs before switching to fallback mode. Thanks again to Dave Shirley!

## [0.5.0] - 2022-10-22

### Added

- New `bigquery-test-fixture:` schema creates small, read-only "tables" very quickly. Many thanks to Dave Shirley for the proof of concept and for pairing on the final implementation.

### Fixed

- Updated a few dependencies with (likely non-exploitable) security advisories. We have not update _all_ our dependencies, because there are at least two regressions affecting supposedly semver-compatible dependencies. This is actually very rare in the Rust ecosystem, but we were unlucky this time.

## [0.5.0-beta.4] - 2022-01-01

### Fixed

- gs: Retry `delete` operations after 403 Forbidden errors. This appears to be part of the same hypothesized permissions race that affected `extract` in v0.5.0-beta.3.

## [0.5.0-beta.3] - 2021-12-31

### Fixed

- bigquery: Retry `extract` operations after `accessDenied` errors. These errors sometimes occur even when BigQuery _should_ have the necessary access permissions. This may be caused by a permissions race condition somewhere in Google Cloud?

## [0.5.0-beta.2] - 2021-12-19

### Changed

- The format for printing backtraces has changed. We now use the standard `anyhow` format.
- Our logging format has changed considerably, thanks to switch from `slog` to the much more popular `tracing`. Some logging of complex async streams may be less well-organized, but there's _more_ of it, especially at `RUST_LOG=dbcrossbarlib=trace,dbcrossbar=trace,warn` level.

### Fixed

- We no longer rely on the unmaintained `failure`, or the less popular `slog` ecosystem.

### Removed

- The `--log-format` and `--log-extra` commands have been removed.

## [0.5.0-beta.1] - 2021-12-15

### Added

- We provide MacOS X binaries for the new M1 processors. These are unsigned, like our existing Apple Intel binaries. So you'll need to continue to use `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine dbcrossbar` or a similar technique to run them. Or you could build your own binaries.

### Changed

- Our downloadable `*.zip` files follow a new naming convention, allowing us to distinguish between Intel and M1 Macs.
- OpenSSL has been completely removed from `dbcrossbar`, allowing us to support more platforms. This will also allow us to eventually centralize TLS configuration across all `dbcrossbar` drivers.

### Removed

- We no longer support hosted Citus from Citus Data, because their TLS certificates do not include `subjectAltName`, which is [required by the `rustls` library](https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/issues/11). Citus Data will be shutting down shortly, so we recommend keeping around an older `dbcrossbar` for a few more weeks if you need to talk to them.

## [0.5.0-alpha.3] - 2021-12-14

### Added

- gs: Allow single-file CSV output. This involves copying out of Google Cloud Storage, concatenating, and copying back. But it's handy when you need it.

### Changed

- gs: Copying to a `gs://bucket/dir/` URL with `--if-exists=overwrite --display-output-locators` will print out a list of files in the destination bucket directory when we're done. Before, it just printed out the destination locator, which was technically allowed, but useless.

### Fixed

- Updated many dependencies, fixing several CVEs (none known to be meaningfully exploitable in typical use cases), and possibly some library bugs.

## [0.5.0-alpha.2] - 2021-04-27

### Fixed

- bigml: Always map columns with a `one-of` type (aka `CREATE ENUM`) to BigML `categorical` columns.

## [0.5.0-alpha.1] - 2021-03-04

This release contains a breaking change to the `dbcrossbar-schema` output format to enable supporting named types and enumeration types. See below.

### Added

- (EXPERIMENTAL) postgres: The `postgres-sql` and `postgres` drivers now `CREATE TYPE` statements (but only in the `"public"` schema). These can be used as follows:

  ```sql
  CREATE TYPE "format" AS ENUM ('gif', 'jpeg');
  CREATE TABLE "images" (
      "id" uuid NOT NULL,
      "url" text NOT NULL,
      "image_format" "format",
      "metadata" jsonb
  );
  ```

  This change also requires some changes to the `dbcrossbar-schema` format, which are described below.

- (EXPERIMENTAL) The native `dbcrossbar-schema` format now supports a set of `named_types` definitions. This allows named types to be defined once, and to then be referred to elsewhere using `{ "named": "my_custom_type" }`.
- (EXPERIMENTAL) The native `dbcrossbar-schema` format also supports string enumeration types using a `{ "one_of": ["red", "green", "blue"] }` syntax.

### Changed

- BREAKING: The `dbcrossbar-schema` output format has changed! It now has top level `named_types` and `tables` members, and the old top-level table definition is now available as `.tables[0]`. See [the manual](https://www.dbcrossbar.org/schema.html) for more details. However, `dbcrossbar` can still read the old input format with no problems, so this only affects other programs that parse native `dbcrossbar` schema.

### Fixed

- The suggested fixes for RUSTSEC-2020-0146, RUSTSEC-2021-0020 and RUSTSEC-2021-0023 have been applied.

## 0.4.2-beta.11 - 2021-02-03

### Fixed

- gcloud: Retry OAuth2 failures for service accounts.

## 0.4.2-beta.10 - 2021-02-02

### Fixed

- Build fixes for recently-added clippy warnings.

## 0.4.2-beta.9 - 2021-01-14

### Changed

- Update many dependencies, including `tokio` and our many network-related libraries. Tests pass, but this affects almost everything, in one fashion or another.

## 0.4.2-beta.8 - 2020-10-16

### Fixed

- Linux: Fix Linux binary builds by updating to latest `rust-musl-builder` release, which has the new `cargo-deny`.

## 0.4.2-beta.7 - 2020-10-14

### Added

- shopify: Added a "partner" argument which can be used to include a "-- partner:" comment in all generated RedShift SQL for use by RedShift partners.

## 0.4.2-beta.6 - 2020-09-15

### Fixed

- shopify: Retry failed downloads a few times. We've been seeing some intermittent failures.

## 0.4.2-beta.5 - 2020-08-01

### Fixed

- gcloud: We now print more useful error messages when Google doesn't send JSON-formatted errors.
- gcloud: We now retry Google Cloud GET requests automatically a few times if it looks like it might help. We'd also love to retry POST requests, but that will require the ability to try to restart streams.

## 0.4.2-beta.4 - 2020-07-07

### Changed

- Update dependencies. The latest `bigml` release contains tweaks to error retry behavior.

## 0.4.2-beta.3 - 2020-07-07

### Changed

- postgres: Our last `diesel` code has been removed, and replaced with `tokio-postgres` (which we use elsewhere).

### Fixed

- postgres: Fixed [#148](https://github.com/dbcrossbar/dbcrossbar/issues/148) to improve support for PostGIS under PostgreSQL 12.

### Removed

- The experimental `citus`-related APIs have been removed from `dbcrossbarlib`, because they used `diesel`. This is technically a breaking change for `dbcrosslib`, but we don't claim to honor semver for `dbcrossbarlib` 0.x.y releases.

## 0.4.2-beta.2 - 2020-06-28

### Added

- redshift: Support `--if-exists=upsert-on:key1,key2`.
- redshift: Enable `--if-exists=error`.

### Changed

- postgres: Temporary tables now use the same schema (i.e. namespace) as the tables they're linked to. This shouldn't be a breaking change unless you've set up your database permissions to forbid it.

### Fixed

- postgres: Fixed likely bug upserting into tables with a non-"public" schema.
- postgres: Verify that upsert columns are NOT NULL to prevent possible incorrect upserts. This may be a breaking change, but it also prevents a possible bug.

## 0.4.2-beta.1 - 2020-06-23

### Changed

- Mac: Move configuration directory from `~/Library/Preferences/dbcrossbar` to `~/Library/Application Support/dbcrossbar`. If we detect a config directory in the old location, we should print a deprecation warning and use it.
- Many dependencies have been updated.

### Fixed

- We should now handle multiple sets of Google Cloud OAuth2 credentials correctly.

## 0.4.1 - 2020-06-16

A bug fix to `gs`, and other minor improvements.

### Changed

- Replace deprecated `tempdir` with `tempfile`.

### Fixed

- gs: Correctly pass `page_token` when listing. This prevents an infinite loop in large directories.
- Fix new Rust 0.44.0 warnings.

## 0.4.0 - 2020-06-02

This is a summary of all the major changes since the 0.3.3 release. For more details and minor changes, see the individual CHANGELOG entries for the 0.4.0 preleases.

### Added

- `dbcrossbar` now supports "struct" types, which have a fixed set of named fields. These will be automatically translated to BigQuery STRUCT types or to JSON columns, depending on the destination database.
- We now support a CLI-editable config file using commands like `dbcrossbar config add temporary s3://example/temp/`.
- Parsing-related error messages should now include context.
- bigquery: Users can now specify billing labels for jobs.
- `dbcrossbar license` will display the licences for all dependencies.
- Unstable features can now be hidden behind the `--enable-unstable` flag, including two new drivers:
  - UNSTABLE: We now support specifying schemas using a subset of TypeScript.
  - UNSTABLE: We now support reading data from Shopify's REST API. This is a testbed for new struct and JSON-related features.

### Changed

- `dbcrossbar conv` is now `dbcrossbar schema conv`.
- Because of the new STRUCT support, some corner cases involving struct types and JSON may have changed subtly.
- We replaced `gcloud auth`, `gsutil` and `bq` with native Rust. This simplifies installation and configuration substantially, and fixes a number of BigQuery-related issues.
- AWS credentials must now always be passed via `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional) and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` (required). This lays the groundwork for replacing the `aws` CLI tool with native Rust code, so that we will someday be able to remove our last CLI dependency.

### Fixed

- Lots of issues.

### Removed

- The data type `{ "other": string }` has been removed from the portable schema format. It was not actually generated by any of our drivers.
- bigquery: We now export `ARRAY<STRUCT<...>>` as `{ "array": { "struct": ... } }`, instead of exporting it as as single `"json"` value.

## 0.4.0-rc.2 - 2020-06-01

### Changed

- postgres: We now transform the portable types `{ "array": "json" }` and `{ "array": { "struct": fields } }` into `jsonb[]`, instead of automatically changing it to plain `jsonb` in an effort to help our users.

## 0.4.0-rc.1 - 2020-05-31

This is a release candidate for v0.4.0. If no issues are discovered, this will be published as 0.4.0.

This release contains a last few breaking changes that we want to include before we publicize `dbcrossbar` more widely. When migrating, particular attention to the `conv` subcommand and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` below, which have significant breaking changes.

### Changed

- Rename `dbcrossbar conv` to `dbcrossbar schema conv`.
- s3: Require `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` instead of optionally using `AWS_REGION`. This is more compatiable with the `aws` CLI command, and it doesn't rely on undocumented region defaults or `aws` configuration files.

### Added

- Document our portable schema format.
- Document schema-only drivers.
- Improve the documentation in other minor ways.

### Removed

- Remove `DataType::Other(String)`, which was not actually used by any of our drivers.

## 0.4.0-beta.1 - 2020-05-28

We're finally ready to start preparing for an 0.4.0 release! This beta will be deployed to several production systems to help verify that there are no surprising regressions.

### Changed

- gs: We now verify CRC32C checksums when uploading.
- gs: We specify `isGenerationMatch` on many operations to make sure that nothing has been created or overridden that we didn't expect.

## 0.4.0-alpha.7 - 2020-05-26

This release adds support for labeling BigQuery jobs.

### Added

- bigquery: Optionally specify billing labels for jobs. See the manual for details.
- Allow driver argument names to be specified as either `x.y` or `x[y]`, interchangeably. This makes `job_labels` look nicer.
- Hide URL passwords from (most) logs using a dedicated wrapper type.

### Changed

- We now have test cases that make sure we catch duplicate driver arguments and raise an error.
- redshift: Authentication argument names may no longer include `-` characters. I'm not even sure whether these are valid, but they won't work with the new scheme for parsing driver arguments.
- `DriverArguments::from_cli_args` now takes an iterator instead of a slice.

## 0.4.0-alpha.6 - 2020-05-22

This release improves the example `shopify.ts` schema, and adds new features to `dbcrossbar-ts` to parse it.

### Added

- dbcrossbar-ts:
  - Parse `/* */` comments.
  - Allow `Date` to be used as a type. This requires the date to be a string in ISO 8601 format, including a time zone.
  - Allow `decimal`, `int16`, `int32` and `int64` to be defined as any of `number`, `string`, `number | string` or `string | number`. This allows the schema to more accurately represent what appears on the wire. It allows `decimal` values to be represented as a mix of floats and strings, which is seen in Shopify.
- postgres-sql: Use new format for parse errors.

### Fixed

- shopify: The example `shopify.ts` schema has been updated to use `Date` and `int64` in many places. `Address` and `CustomerAddress` are now distinct types, and several other minor issues have been fixed.

## 0.4.0-alpha.5 - 2020-05-21

### Added

- BigQuery: Support `--if-exists=error`.

### Changed

- Require `--enable-unstable` to use `dbcrossbar-ts` or `shopify` locators, which are unstable.
- AWS credentials must now always be passed via `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional) and `AWS_REGION` (optional). This lays the groundwork for replacing the `aws` CLI tool with native Rust code, so that we will someday be able to remove our last CLI dependency.

## 0.4.0-alpha.4 - 2020-05-19

### Added

- BigQuery now imports and exports decimal (aka NUMERIC) values everywhere.
- The `dbcrossbar-ts` driver now supports magic type aliases that will convert to the corresponding `dbcrossbar` types:
  - `type decimal = string;`
  - `type int16 = number | string;`
  - `type int32 = number | string;`
  - `type int64 = number | string;`

### Changed

- The sample `shopify.ts` schema now uses `decimal` instead of `string` when appropriate. It does not attempt to use `int64` yet.

## 0.4.0-alpha.3 - 2020-05-19 0 YANKED

This release was yanked because it was missing several things it should have included.

## 0.4.0-alpha.2 - 2020-05-19

This is a significant release, with support for "struct" types.

### Added

- The portable schema now supports a `DataType::Struct(fields)` type that can be used to represent BigQuery STRUCT values (as long as they have unique, named fields) and JSON objects with known keys.
- The BigQuery driver now supports importing and exporting `STRUCT` fields using the new `DataType::Struct(fields)` type.
- EXPERIMENTAL: Schemas can now be specified using the `dbcrossbar-ts` driver, which supports subset of TypeScript type declarations. This is useful for specifying complex, nested structs. This can be used as `--schema="dbcrossbar-ts:shopify.ts#Order"`, where `Order` is the name of the type within the `*.ts` file to use as the table's type.
- EXPERIMENTAL: We now support a Shopify input driver that uses the Shopify REST API. See the manual for details.
- We now have support for fancy parser error messages, which we use with the `dbcrossbar-ts` parser.
- We now support a CLI-editable config file using commands like `dbcrossbar config add temporary s3://example/temp/`.

### Changed

- BREAKING: Some corner cases involving struct types and JSON may have changed subtly.
- We've upgraded to the latest `rust-peg` parser syntax everywhere.

### Fixed

- `--if-exists=overwrite` now overwrites when writing to local files (instead of appending).
- We automatically create `~/.local/share` if it does not exist.
- More `clippy` warnings have been fixed, and unsafe code has been forbidden.
- Various obsolete casting libraries have been removed.

## 0.4.0-alpha.1 - 2020-04-07

### Changed

- Replace `gcloud auth`, `gsutil` and `bq` with native Rust. This changes how we authenticate to Google Cloud. In particular, we now support `GCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET`, `~/.config/dbcrossbar/gcloud_client_secret.json`, `GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` or `~/.config/dbcrossbar/gcloud_service_account_key.json`, as [explained in the manual](https://www.dbcrossbar.org/gs.html#configuration--authentication). We no longer use `gcloud auth`, and the Google Cloud SDK tools are no longer required. In the current alpha version, uploads and deletions are probably slower than before.

### Fixed

- gs: Avoid download stalls when backpressure is applied ([#103](https://github.com/dbcrossbar/dbcrossbar/issues/102)).
- bigquery: Display error messages more reliably ([#110](https://github.com/dbcrossbar/dbcrossbar/issues/110)).
- bigquery: Detect "\`" quotes in the CLI form of table names, and report an error.

## 0.3.3 - 2020-03-30

### Added

- BigML: Honor BIGML_DOMAIN, allowing the user to point the BigML driver to a custom VPC instance of BigML.

## 0.3.2 - 2020-03-30

### Fixed

- Correctly quote BigQuery column names again (which regressed in 0.3.0), and added test cases to prevent further regressions.
- Fix an error that caused `bigquery_upsert` test to fail.

## 0.3.1 - 2020-03-29

### Added

- Write a new [manual](https://www.dbcrossbar.org/)!

### Changed

- Encapsulate all calls to `bq` and `gsutil`
- Improve performance of `--stream-size`

### Fixed

- BigQuery: Honor NOT NULL on import (fixes #45)

## 0.3.0 - 2020-03-26

### Added

- Use `cargo deny` to enforce license and duplicate dependency policies
- Add notes about license and contribution policies

### Changed

- Update to tokio 0.2 and the latest stable Rust
- Replace `wkb` with `postgis` for licensing reasons
- BigML: Fail immediately if no S3 temporary bucket provided (fixes #101)

### Fixed

- BigQuery: Handle mixed-case column names using BigQuery semantics (fixes #84)
- PostgreSQL: Fix upserts with mixed-case column names
- BigQuery: Correctly output NULL values in Boolean columns (#104)

### Removed

- BREAKING: BigQuery: Remove code that tried to rename column names to make them valid (fixes #84)
